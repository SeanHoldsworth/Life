# Conway's Game of Life

This is one of several Java applications I wrote as part of a course on
object oriented programming.

The project is in the standard Java format and so should import cleanly into
an IDE such as NetBeans. As such the actual source files are hidden away in
the bottom of the nested directory structure under the src folder.

I've provided a couple of shell scripts called run.sh and build.sh which do
what their names probably suggest; run the compiled binary and build the
application. Building has been tested as working under both macOS and Linux
and the generated .jar file tested was also running on Windows. The .jar file
should be able to be run on any environment supporting the JVM and Swing.

Further documentation about the application can be found in life.pdf.

If you're running on macOS or Linux you should be able to run the .jar file
directly using "java -jar LifeApp.jar".
